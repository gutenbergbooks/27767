<h1>SLAVERY: WHAT IT WAS, WHAT IT HAS DONE, WHAT<br />
IT INTENDS TO DO.</h1>

<hr />

<h2><span class="sp1">SPEECH</span><br />
<span class="sp2">OF</span><br />
HON. CYDNOR B. TOMPKINS, OF OHIO.</h2>

<hr />

<p class="center"><big>Delivered in the House of Representatives, April 24, 1860.</big></p>

<hr />

<p class="bk1">Mr. TOMPKINS said:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: The charge is frequently made,
that nothing but slavery occupies the attention
of the National Legislature. That this charge is
true to a great extent, that this subject is constantly
kept before the country, and that there
is constant excitement about it, is not the fault
of the Republican party. In the first hour of the
present session of Congress, it was thrust upon
the House by a member of the slavery party; for
two months a discussion was continued upon
that subject, and almost exclusively by that
party&mdash;a discussion unparalleled in point of violence
and virulence in the history of Parliamentary
debate. Charges the most aggravated were
unscrupulously and shamelessly made against
the best and purest men of the country, and honorable
members on this floor. Calumny and
vituperation held high carnival in the legislative
halls of this great nation. The columns of the
<i>Daily Globe</i> teemed with fierce and fiery denunciations
of all who would not bow to the behests
of pro-slavery power. Depraved, corrupt, and
polluted presses exerted themselves to the utmost
in the work of slander and detraction; hireling
scribblers for worse than hireling presses glutted
themselves and <i>made their meals on good men's
names</i>. These spacious galleries were filled with
disloyal men, ready to applaud to the echo every
threat uttered against the Government, and every
disloyal sentiment heard from this floor.</p>

<p>If the Republicans here shall feel it to be their
duty to discuss this subject now; to lay bare its
weakness and its wickedness; to expose the
madness and the folly of those who sustain, support,
and cherish it; if the great interests of the
country have to be neglected for a time; if ordinary
legislation must be put aside, no complaint
can be made against the Republican party. That
party, its principles, its men, and its measures,
have been misrepresented, and most unjustly assailed.
It is our privilege, it is our duty, to repel
those assaults, that the world may know that
when the advanced guard of freedom is attacked,
"our feet shall be always in the arena, and our
shields shall hang always in the lists."</p>

<p>I intend to review this question for the time
allowed me. I hope to do so with fairness and
candor, and not with the passion and excitement
that have characterized many speeches made
this session by pro-slavery members. I shall
endeavor to show that the fathers of this Republic,
both of the North and South, were more
thoroughly anti-slavery than any political party
now in the country; and that, for more than forty
years after its organization, a large majority of
our prominent men were strongly opposed to the
extension of that "<i>patriarchal</i> institution."</p>

<p>The debates in the Federal Convention show
that the Constitution was framed, adopted, and
ratified, by anti-slavery men; that they regarded
it as an evil, yet were ashamed to acknowledge
its existence in words&mdash;thus virtually refusing to
recognise property in many Resolutions, addresses,
and speeches, now to be found, establish
this very important fact, as I will show by
quotations from them.</p>

<p>At a general meeting in Prince George county,
Virginia, it was</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That the African slave trade is injurious
to this colony, obstructs the population
of it by free men, and prevents manufacturers
from Europe from settling among us."</p>

<p>At a meeting in Culpeper county, Virginia, it
was</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That the importation of slaves obstructs
the population with free white men and
useful manufacturers."</p>

<p>At a meeting in Nansemond county, Virginia,
it was</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That the African slave trade is injurious
to this colony, obstructs the population
by free men, and prevents manufacturers from
settling amongst us."</p>

<p>Resolutions to the same effect were adopted
in Surrey county, Caroline county; and at a
meeting in Fairfax county, over which George
Washington presided, resolutions of like import
were adopted.</p>

<p>At a very full meeting of delegates from the
different counties of the Colony and Dominion
of Virginia, at Williamsburg, on the 1st day of
August, 1774, it was</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, that the abolition of domestic slavery
is the greatest object of desire in these
colonies, where it was improperly introduced
in their infant state."</p>

<p>This is the language of the good and wise men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of the Old Dominion in 1774; "the <i>abolition</i> of
domestic slavery was the greatest object of their
desire." Not merely to limit it, to prevent its
extension, but wholly to overthrow it. What
would be said if a body of men, equally wise,
good, and patriotic, should <i>now</i> meet in the Old
Dominion, and attempt to pass such resolutions?
They would be scourged, driven by violence from
the State, and might be considered fortunate
should they escape with their lives. At a meeting
in New Bern, North Carolina, August, 1774,
numerously attended by the most distinguished
men of that region, it was resolved that they
would not import any slave or slaves, or purchase
any slave or slaves imported or brought
into that province by others from any part of
the world. Such was the sentiment of North
Carolina in 1774, as to the evil and great wrong
of slavery.</p>

<p>The Continental Congress, in October, 1774,
resolved that they would neither import, nor
purchase any slave imported, after December of
the same year; they agreed and resolved that
they would have no trade, commerce, dealings,
or intercourse whatsoever, with any colony or
province in North America which should not
accede to, or should violate, this resolve, but
would hold them as unworthy the rights of freemen
and inimical to the liberties of this country.</p>

<p>But what is now the attitude of slaveholders?
They will hold no intercourse, they will have no
dealings, with any person or State that does not
approve of slavery, and yield to its intolerant
and despotic demands; if any man, not thus approving
and yielding, chances to travel through
the slave States, and there to express his sentiments,
he is subjected to the degradation and
cruelty of the lash, and is driven from the State.</p>

<p>October 21, 1774, the Continental Congress, in
an address to the people of Great Britain, said:</p>

<p>"When a nation, led to greatness by the hand
of liberty, and possessed of all the glory that
heroism, munificence, and humanity, can bestow,
descends to the ungrateful task of forging
chains for her friends and children, and, instead
of giving support to freedom, turns advocate
for slavery and oppression, there is reason to
suspect that she has either ceased to be virtuous,
or is extremely negligent in the appointment
of her rulers."</p>

<p>Is not this the situation and condition of this
country now? Is not a great party now engaged
in the ungrateful task of forging chains for a large
portion of the people of this country? Instead
of supporting freedom, does it not advocate slavery
and oppression? Have we not reason to
suspect that too many of our countrymen have
ceased to be virtuous?</p>

<p>By the Darien committee, Georgia, January,
1775, it was declared:</p>

<p>"To show the world that we are not influenced
by any contracted and interested motives, but
a general philanthropy for all mankind, of whatever
language or complexion, we hereby declare
our disapprobation and abhorrence of the unnatural
practice of slavery in America&mdash;a practice
founded in injustice and cruelty, and highly
dangerous to our liberties."</p>

<p>I cannot quote at greater length from the proceedings
of this committee. Their philanthropy
was without regard to complexion; they abhorred
slavery, as based on injustice and cruelty; and
more, as dangerous to our liberties. If it were
founded in injustice and cruelty in 1775, it is the
same in 1860. It was dangerous to liberty <i>then</i>;
no man <i>now</i> apprehends any danger to liberty,
unless from the same source. It is daily threatened
by men who are interested in slavery. Liberty
cannot be very secure where four million
human beings are held in hopeless bondage&mdash;where
human blood, bone, muscle, and, I might
almost say, immortal souls, are articles of merchandise.</p>

<p>The historical quotations I have made bring me
to the Revolution. I will cite the opinions of
some of the great actors in that great drama.
George Washington said, in his will:</p>

<p>"Upon the decease of my wife, it is my desire
that the slaves whom I hold <i>in my own right</i>
should receive their freedom."</p>

<p>Again, he said:</p>

<p>"I never mean, unless some particular circumstance
should compel me, to possess another
slave by purchase, it being my first wish to see
some plan adopted by which slavery in this
country may be abolished by law."</p>

<p>La Fayette, while in the prison of Magdeburg,
said:</p>

<p>"I know not what disposition has been made
of my plantation at Cayenne; but I hope Madame
de La Fayette will take care that the
negroes who cultivate it shall preserve their
liberties."</p>

<p>Washington wrote to Robert Morris:</p>

<p>"It will not be conceived, from these observations,
that it is my wish to hold these unhappy
people (negroes) in slavery. I can only say
that there is not a man living who wishes more
sincerely than I do to see a plan adopted for
the abolition of it."</p>

<p>Again, he writes to La Fayette:</p>

<p>"The benevolence of your heart, my dear Marquis,
is so conspicuous on all occasions, that I
never wonder at any fresh proof of it; but your
late purchase of an estate in the colony of Cayenne,
with a view of emancipating the slaves
on it, is a generous and noble proof of your
humanity. Would to God a like spirit might
diffuse itself generally into the people of this
country!"</p>

<p>Washington hoped for some plan by which
slavery might be legally abolished. Washington
lauded the humanity of La Fayette in purchasing
an estate for the purpose of emancipating the
negroes. I will leave it to gentlemen on the other
side to draw the comparison between the chivalry
of the South <i>then</i> and <i>now</i>; between the
licentious assumption of thought and utterance
permitted <i>then</i>, and the course of conviction and
conversion esteemed necessary and equitable
<i>now</i>, towards hapless offenders in the footsteps
of predecessors so illustrious.</p>

<p>Patrick Henry said:</p>

<p>"Slavery is detested; we feel its fatal effects;
we deplore it with all the pity of humanity. I
repeat again, that it would rejoice my very soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that every one of my fellow beings were emancipated.
We ought to lament and deplore the
necessity of holding our fellow men in bondage."</p>

<p>Charles Pinckney, Governor of South Carolina,
said:</p>

<p>"I must say that I lament the decision of your
Legislature upon the question of the importation
of slaves after March, 1793. I was in
hopes that motives of policy, as well as other
good reasons, supported by the direful effects
of slavery which at this moment are presented,
would have operated to produce a total prohibition
of the importation of slaves, whenever
the question came to be agitated in any State
that might be interested in the measure."</p>

<p>Such were the sentiments of the most enlightened,
the most virtuous men of our country in its
heroic age. George Mason, of Virginia, stigmatized
the slave trade as an "infernal traffic!"
He said that "slavery discouraged manufactures;
that it produced the most pernicious effect on
manners." Without intending to be personal
or offensive, I think I can pause here and properly
remark, that if the effects of slavery are
changed in every other respect, the effect on
manners is the same now that it was in the last
century. The epithets used by men on this
floor, their arrogant bearing towards their peers,
is abundant proof that there is no change in that
respect. We have frequently heard members,
this session, speak of a great party in this country
as the Black Republican party. Legislative
bodies in the slave States have so far forgotten
what should be due to the standing and dignity of
a Legislature, as to call a certain party, in their official
proceedings, the "Black Republican party."
Why are men betrayed into such violations of
the proprieties of life? There can be no other
reason than the one given by George Mason
eighty years ago: slavery produces a most pernicious
effect upon manners. I know it is
claimed, by men in the slave States, that slavery
is necessary to the highest development of human
society; but I think the experience of members
of Congress is, that slavery does not always
produce this beneficial result.</p>

<p>I revert to my Southern authorities upon the
peculiar institution. Mr. Iredell, of North Carolina,
thus expresses himself:</p>

<p>"When the entire abolition of slavery takes
place, it will be an event which must be most
pleasing to every generous mind, and to every
friend of human nature."</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson writes:</p>

<p>"The spirit of the master is abating: that of
the slave rising from the dust; his condition
mollifying; the way, I hope, preparing, under
the auspices of Heaven, for a total emancipation."</p>

<p>He continues, in his plan for a Constitution for
Virginia:</p>

<p>"Nothing is more certainly written in the book
of fate, than that these people are to be free."</p>

<p>In a letter to Dr. Gordon, on Lord Cornwallis's
invasion of Virginia, Mr. Jefferson says:</p>

<p>"He carried off also about thirty slaves, (Jefferson's.)
Had this been to give them freedom,
he would have done right; but it was to consign
them to inevitable death from small-pox
and putrid fever then raging in his camp."</p>

<p>I conclude here my citations from the united
voices of some of the best men of the country,
before and after the Revolution, against slavery
as an evil, and a great national sin, not that I
have exhausted their utterances, but that my
time admits of no more.</p>

<p>The Republican party proclaims no doctrine
so <i>ultra</i> as theirs, uses no language so strong as
that of those Southern statesmen from whom it
gains so much information, and whose views, to
a great extent, it conscientiously accepts. We
desire only to confine it within its present limits;
we ask that it shall not pollute territory now
free; we know the utter folly of appealing to
the morality or humanity of a pro-slavery party,
where the rights of a black man are involved;
but when you insist on taking slaves into a free
Territory, and smiting the land with this blighting,
withering curse, we plant ourselves on our
constitutional rights, and say, <i>thus far shall you
go, and no further</i>.</p>

<p>The learned gentleman from Alabama, [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Curry</span>,] in alluding to the opinion of the fathers
of the Republic, said:</p>

<p>"These, however, were but mere speculations."</p>

<p>Was it a mere speculation when Madison said,
"we have seen a mere distinction of color made
the ground of the most oppressive dominion of
man over man?" Was it as a mere speculation
that Jefferson wrote, that Cornwallis would have
been right, had he carried away his (Jefferson's)
slaves to free them? Was it a mere speculation,
a wild fancy, that the framers of the Constitution
would not admit that there could be such
a thing as property in man? A mere speculation,
was it, of Patrick Henry, when he said "that
slavery is detested; we feel its fatal effects; we
deplore it?" when he declared it would "rejoice
his very soul, were all his fellow beings
emancipated?" Was it a mere speculation
when Jefferson wrote, and his colleagues signed,
"we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal?" No one then doubted
the truth of this declaration. More than a generation
passed away before any man dared raise
his voice against it. No, sir; this was no mere
speculation, but the acknowledgment of a great
"humanitarian fact." True then, it is true now;
and must remain indisputable and eternal&mdash;a
pillar of fire by night, a cloud by day, to guide
and guard nations yet unborn in the path of
honor, of safety, of moral and political grandeur.</p>

<p>But the learned gentleman does not pause
upon these "speculations." He proceeds to tell
us that circumstances are changed; that there
was then little more than half a million slaves,
and scarce a pound of cotton exported. Does
the gentleman believe, or does he but attempt
to lead <i>us</i> to believe, that the ethics of those
men "without fear and without reproach" had
no sounder foundation than this: that while
slaves were few and cotton scarce, slavery might
be a wrong, but with four million slaves and
four million two hundred thousand bales of cotton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
it becomes just, humane, moral?&mdash;that
while negroes and cotton fill one side of the
scales, Christian truth must kick the beam on
the other, and slavery thus becomes a great
"humanitarian fact?"</p>

<p>The right and wrong of the thing, about which
there has been so much discussion, is now easily
solved. The gentleman has found an infallible
rule; it is simply to make a chemical analysis
of your soil; if it will produce cotton, you can
purchase slaves and work them without violating
the laws of God or man.</p>

<p>We may also infer, or be induced to believe,
from the honorable gentleman's speech, that if
nothing is raised but indigo and rice, the propriety
and morality of holding men in bondage is
doubtful. Not such, sir, were the "<i>speculations</i>"
of the fathers of the Republic.</p>

<p>Lucid as is the gentleman's speech in general,
there is a want of clearness in the last point I
have cited; but this is owing entirely to the
materials used in the demonstration&mdash;rice and
indigo will not do; nothing will serve but cotton;
cotton ever, cotton only.</p>

<p>If slave labor, then, is profitable, slaveholding
is equitable. Thus it is decided, that whatever
is profitable is also equitable: justice and injustice
are mere matters of profit and loss; the
morality or immorality of slavery a mere question
of soil and climate.</p>

<p>The great authorities cited as to the evil effects
of slavery on the white race, should satisfy the
most incredulous. But, says the learned gentleman
from Alabama, there were few slaves at
that time, and scarce a pound of cotton for exportation.
Let us, then, pass from that period,
to one when the few slaves had become millions,
and the bales of cotton exported were estimated
in like manner. In 1832, Thomas Marshall, of
Virginia, said of slavery:</p>

<p>"It is ruinous to the whites; retards improvement;
roots out an industrious population;
banishes the yeomanry of the country;
deprives the spinner, the weaver, the smith, the
shoemaker, the carpenter, of employment and
support. Labor of every species is disreputable,
because performed mostly by slaves; the
general aspect of the country marks the curse
of a wasteful, idle, reckless population, who
have no interest in the soil, and care not how
much it is impoverished."</p>

<p>Mr. Berry, of Virginia, spoke thus:</p>

<p>"I believe that no cancer on the physical body
was ever more certain, steady, and fatal, in its
progress, than is the cancer of slavery on the
political body of the State of Virginia. It is
eating into her very vitals."</p>

<p>The records of Southern statesmanship, sir,
abound in such and stronger expressions. Slavery
had then existed in this country more than
two hundred years, yet scarce a man could be
then found so bold and so reckless as to proclaim
it just and righteous, a humane, a Christian
institution. Nearly the whole civilized world
united in its condemnation; the ministers of our
holy religion in the slave States declaimed
against it; their solemn petitions ascended to
the throne of God, that the country might be
rid of these "bonds." But, slave labor has become
profitable in some parts of the South; the
<i>mania</i> for wealth has seized the slaveholder's
avarice, has dried up the fountain of humanity.
The lust of power and dominion deadens their
consciences; a million bales of cotton can blind
their eyes alike to the flames of perdition and
the glories of Paradise. They make to themselves
friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness;
they become full, and deny their Maker,
and say, who is the Lord! Concerning oppression,
they speak loftily. But they are set in slippery
places; they will be cast down unto destruction.</p>

<p>The gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. <span class="smcap">Lamar</span>]
said, a few days since:</p>

<p>"I tell you, Mr. Chairman, that God's sun
does not shine upon a nobler, prouder, more
prosperous, and elevated class of people, than
the non-slaveholders of the South."</p>

<p>This, I think, will be news to many non-slaveholders
in the gentleman's district. Thomas Jefferson
tells us that man is an imitative animal;
therefore, if the assertion of the gentleman from
Mississippi be correct, we must wonder why
slaveholders do not relieve themselves of their
negroes, that they may become equally noble,
proud, prosperous, and elevated, with the non-slaveholder.
Who can compare with them on
this side of Paradise? With them, the millennium
can be no object of desire, since</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Not a wave of trouble rolls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across their peaceful breasts."<br /></span></div>

<p>Still there must be some malice in their hearts,
for the honorable gentleman states that they
(the non-slaveholders) hold slavery in the hollow
of their hands; surely, were they benevolent,
they would close their hands and crush out
the "institution," that their slaveholding fellow-citizens
might become as prosperous and as
happy as themselves.</p>

<p>The assertion is frequently made, that white
men cannot work in the hot latitudes of the
South, and this is offered as a reason why there
should be black slaves there. The gentleman
knocks one of the strongest props from under the
institution. He tells us white men work, and
raise not only cotton, but corn and potatoes. He
also informs us that after the cotton, corn, and
potatoes, are raised, the strong, brave man
drives the plow through the fallow ground.
It will be seen that work during the summer
has not produced the lassitude and enervation
that it has been claimed is produced in white
men by labor. We are still further informed,
that the fallow ground turned up by the
strong, brave man, discloses something more
valuable than the gold of California&mdash;"'Tis the
sparkles of liberty!" We have heard of the
sparkles of liberty that are made manifest to the
non-slaveholders of the South. The poor laboring
man at Columbia, South Carolina, when
streams of blood issued from the furrows plowed
in his naked back by a cow-hide in the hands of
a negro, saw some of the sparkles of liberty,
when, bleeding, exhausted, besmeared with tar,
and covered with feathers, he was thrust into
the cars, and left to perish in the cold. He had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
no doubt, a vivid idea of the liberty that is enjoyed
by non-slaveholders in the South, when
he remembered that these cruelties and barbarities
were inflicted on him for expressing a rational
and honest opinion relative to this "peculiar
institution."</p>

<p>The statements, and doubtless convictions, of
the honorable member from Mississippi, differ
singularly from those of Senator <span class="smcap">Clay</span>, of Alabama,
who tells us that, in his State, "we may
behold numerous fine houses, once the abode
of intelligent freemen, now occupied by slaves,
or else tenantless and dilapidated; that we
may see fields, once fertile, covered with foxtail
and broom-sedge&mdash;moss growing on the
walls of once thrifty villages, and may find that
'one only master grasps the whole domain'
which once furnished homes for a dozen white
families."</p>

<p>Hear, also, Senator <span class="smcap">Hammond</span>, of South Carolina,
who says of the non-slaveholders of his
State:</p>

<p>"They obtain a precarious subsistence by occasional
jobs, by hunting, by fishing, by plundering
fields or folds, or, too often, by what is
far worse in its effects, trading with slaves, and
leading them to plunder for their benefit."</p>

<p>The opinions already quoted from many of the
wise men of the South go far to demonstrate
that the gentleman from Mississippi is entirely
mistaken. There is, however, another test by
which we can try the accuracy of what the gentleman
has said about the non-slaveholders of
the South. The census report of 1850 shows
this important fact: that of the white men in
the slave States over twenty-one years of age,
there is about one in every twelve that cannot
read and write; while in the free States there is
only one out of every forty-five. It must also be
remembered, that a very large number of those
in the free States who cannot read, came originally
from the slave States. Take, for instance,
Massachusetts, where there are but very few persons
from the slave States, if any, and there is
only one in seven hundred and seventy-eight
that cannot read and write. Take Indiana and
Illinois&mdash;States that have large populations from
the slave States&mdash;Indiana, one in every fourteen
cannot read; in Illinois, one in every twenty-one
and a half; and if any one will take the
trouble to examine, it will no doubt be found
that this ignorance exists almost entirely where
the population from the slave States largely predominates.
I will venture the assertion, that
there can scarcely be a man found in the State
of Ohio, that was born there, who possesses intellect
capable of cultivation, that cannot read;
while a very large portion of those ignorant men
in the slave States were "to the manor born."</p>

<p>It must also be borne in mind that, in making
the estimate of the free States, the men that perform
all the labor are included. In the slave
States, the men who do nearly all the work are
not included. I do not know that any great
good can come of making these comparisons.
But when the gentleman tells us that the non-slaveholders
in his State are the most prosperous
and the most elevated of mankind, the inquiry
is at once presented to the mind, how elevated
in the scale of existence can a man be who can
neither read nor write?</p>

<p>I have shown that slavery was regarded as a
political, moral, and social evil, by the founders
of this Republic, and by able Southern statesmen
within thirty years; that their anxious
query has been, "what is to be done with it?"
We are now asked to discredit those men, and
give ear to a modern creed, that slavery is not
only necessary, but beneficent&mdash;a divine ordinance&mdash;and
that Southern non-slaveholders,
even, are prosperous and elevated just in proportion
to the number of slaves owned by their
neighbors.</p>

<p>Not such, sir, were the "speculations" of the
fathers of the Republic; nor is the world to be
deceived by such assumptions. Decree and carry
out what non-intercourse you will; surround
yourselves with barriers as impassable as the Chinese
wall, or the great gulf between Dives and
Lazarus, still the evidences of your condition will
exist on the imperishable pages of history, in the
records left by the mighty and venerated dead;
and the attempt to establish the belief that slavery
is a universal blessing will be received but
as an aggression upon the credulity of mankind.</p>

<p>Forty years ago, a slave Territory applied for
admission to the Union as a State. The friends
of freedom objected that its reception would be
contrary to the policy of our Government. "Admit
it," it was urged, "with its present Constitution,
and we will consent to a line of demarkation,
north of which slavery shall never pass."
This was solemnly agreed to before the whole
world; and this compact, forced upon the country
by the slave power, was claimed by it as a
great triumph of slavery. Men at the North felt
that this was a great aggression, a great outrage
upon freedom; yet, to give quiet and restore
harmony, they submitted, consoled by the national
pledge that slavery should be extended no
further, and believing that the nation might joyously
look forward to long years of happiness
and repose. But despotism is ever restless and
grasping; but twenty-five years rolled by&mdash;a very
short period in the life of a nation&mdash;ere Texas
was admitted to the Union, that slavery propagandists
could have a wider field for their operations.
As everybody foresaw, war ensued;
and the best blood of the nation fattened the
soil of Mexico. More than two hundred millions
of treasure were expended, and many thousand
valuable lives sacrificed. All over this land, "the
sky was hung with blackness;" "mourning was
spread over the mountain tops." Territory enough
was obtained to make four large States, well
adapted to the productive labor of human chattels,
and this territory was blackened over with
slavery. Such a triumph ought to have satisfied
the most grasping of the friends of this "peculiar
institution;" but the world should have
known that nothing short of universal dominion
would satisfy the slave owner and slave breeder.
Less than ten years after the annexation of Texas,
it was discovered by Southern men that there
was a Territory west of Missouri, wherein the
peculiar institution of the South could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
made profitable; but by a solemn league and
covenant this land had been, for more than a
third of a century, consecrated to freedom. This
bond of national faith, this pledge of national
honor, stood in the road of their ambition.</p>

<p>But men whose lives are but a series violations
of the dearest rights that God has bestowed
on man cannot be expected to be bound by
pledges of national faith and national honor.
This time-honored compact was annulled, the
barrier between freedom and slavery broken
down. The whole country was astounded at
the perfidy of the act.</p>

<p>But the climax was not reached. The Territory
was overrun with desperadoes; ruffians
from adjoining States usurped the rights of actual
settlers, stuffed ballot-boxes with illegal
votes, and elected members of their own lawless
bands to the Legislature, to enact laws by which
every friend of freedom might be driven from the
country.</p>

<p>Innocent and unoffending men were murdered
in cold blood, houses were consumed with fire,
hamlets laid in smoking ruins, homeless and
houseless innocents, women and tender children,
were driven forth, exposed to the winds and
storms of heaven.</p>

<p>All these wrongs, all these outrages, all these
crimes of blood and deeds of horror, were committed
to plant the accursed institution on the
soil that had been, by a great national act, dedicated
to freedom. But violence and arson, bloodshed
and murder, failed. The black banner of
slavery is trailing in the dust. The stars and
stripes wave triumphantly over a free and joyous
people. The heretofore invincible is conquered.
I have borrowed the word "aggression" to express
the conduct of the South toward the
North. I do not intend to make the charge
without the specifications.</p>

<p>1. I charge upon slavery, that the enforcement
of the Missouri compromise was an aggression
upon the North.</p>

<p>2. I charge the annexation of Texas, whereby
the Mexican war was brought upon the country,
more than two hundred millions of money were
spent, and many thousand lives sacrificed, as an
aggression.</p>

<p>3. I charge that the adoption of the fugitive
slave law, with many of its odious and obnoxious
provisions, was an aggression upon the people of
the North.</p>

<p>4. I charge that the decision of the Supreme
Court in the Dred Scott case was an aggression
upon the North. It was a decision made for the
benefit of slavery, and to deprive the people of
the free States of their equal rights in the Territories.</p>

<p>5. I charge that the repeal of the Missouri compromise
line was an outrageous aggression upon
the rights of the North; disreputable to the nation,
and dishonorable to the party engaged in
it; one that has brought in its train innumerable
woes, and created an excitement that will
not be allayed during the present generation.</p>

<p>6. I charge that the murders, robberies, and
arsons, in Kansas, were aggressions of slavery.</p>

<p>All these things I have charged as aggressions
of slavery are national aggressions, for which
the slavery party, having control of the administration
of this Government, are responsible. I
charge them as direct, positive aggressions, on
the rights of the free people of the North. In
addition to these great national aggressions,
there are numerous similar infringements upon
the rights of individuals of the North&mdash;of tarring
and feathering, of whipping&mdash;acts of such barbarity
and cruelty, that it would chill a man's
blood to hear them recited.</p>

<p>Recently, a whole community of moral, peaceable
citizens were driven from their homes, compelled
to abandon their property, and seek refuge
in a free State, from the violence of slaveholders.
There are, no doubt, many good and humane
men in slave States, who deprecate these
wrongs; but they dare not utter a word&mdash;every
mouth must be stopped, every lip must be sealed,
every voice must be hushed, all must be silent
as the grave&mdash;the most inexorable despotism
reigns supreme.</p>

<p>Having endeavored to show what slavery was,
and what it has done, I now propose to show what
it intends to do. Its advocates claim that the
territory now belonging to the Government is
the common property of all the States, having
been acquired by the common blood and treasure
of all; that, therefore, the inhabitants of the
slave States have a right to emigrate to the Territories,
and take with them their slaves. I am
willing to admit that the inhabitants of one section
of the country have just the same rights in
the Territories that the inhabitants of another
section have. I say it would be an act of injustice
to deny one man any right in the Territory
that another man has, and would be just cause
of complaint. But I am not willing to give to a
man from a slave State any greater rights than
to a man from a free State. And when I have
admitted that all have the same constitutional
rights in the Territories, I have by no means admitted
that men from the South have a right to
hold slaves in the Territories. You may go, and
take your slaves with you, if you have a mind
to run the risk; I say you shall not take your
slave laws with you.</p>

<p>I say that slavery is but the creation of some
local enactment, and that no property can exist
in a human being, unless it is made so by some
law. This opinion was entertained by the founders
of this Republic, and by nearly every statesman
in this country, until very recently. We
hear much said about the constitutional rights
of the South; it is thundered in our ears from
the beginning to the end of the session of Congress.
What is meant by this stereotyped expression,
I do not exactly comprehend; and, I
presume, many who make use of the phrase do not
understand it. If you mean by this that the Constitution
of the United States gives you the right
to go into the Territories belonging to the people
of this country, and take with you not only your
human chattels, but also your bloody slave laws,
I say, you have no such constitutional rights.
The Constitution of the United States nowhere
recognises slaves as property. The Supreme
Court of the United States has decided that slaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
are not property under the Constitution. The
Constitution gives you the right to reclaim your
slaves, if they escape into any other State; this
is all the right it gives you, and all there is in
the Constitution that can by any possibility be
construed to apply to slaves. To contend that
there is any power given in the Constitution
which enables the slaveholder to take his slaves
with him into a Territory, and not only his slaves,
but his slave laws, and the slave laws of all the
slave States, is an assumption of power that I
am not willing to concede to him. It is claimed
that if persons from the slave States are not permitted
to go into the Territories, and take with
them their slaves and slave laws, the rights of
the slave States are violated. This cannot be.
If you claim to take into the Territories the laws
of the slave States, and not only the laws, but
the Constitution of a slave State, I claim, also,
that I will take the Constitution of my State,
which says there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude; and if you do not permit
this, the rights of my State are violated, if your
doctrine be true.</p>

<p>The emigrants from every State in the Union,
under the power claimed by the slavery propagandists,
would have a right to take with them
all the constitutions and all the laws of all the
States. The confusion which would follow would
be worse than at the Tower of Babel. If a citizen
of any slave State leaves it, and goes into a
free State or Territory to reside, he takes with
him none of the rights or powers with which his
State clothed him while he remained therein.
He can take with him such articles as, by the
universal consent of mankind, are considered
property, and exercise ownership over them.
When at home, I am a legal voter; I can vote
for any State or county officer, or President of
the United States. But if I cross the river, a
distance of eighty rods, or go out of my election
district, or in any other direction, I have no such
privilege. The right of suffrage, which is the
highest right that ever can be exercised by a
citizen, is controlled by the laws and Constitution
of each particular State. In the State of
Ohio, a man need not be a property holder to
entitle him to the right of suffrage; if he remove
into a State where he must have a property
qualification before he can vote, are the rights of
the State he left violated? I presume no one
will contend that they are. A man may have
some power in the State of Virginia, given by its
Legislature&mdash;the right to issue paper money, for
instance; but if he remove to Ohio, he has not
this right. No man would pretend to claim that
any of the rights of Virginia are infringed.</p>

<p>Yet the man who would make this claim, would
be just as reasonable as he who should claim
that the rights of Virginia are invaded because
her slaveholders are not permitted to take slaves
into Kansas or Nebraska.</p>

<p>I understand those Southern men, who talk so
much about Southern rights, claim not only the
right to take slaves into the Territories, but they
claim the right to take slave laws and the habits
and customs which are practiced in the slave
States. They claim to take laws by which four
million negroes are reduced to the condition of
brutes. Six million white men, women, and
children, who have to obtain their living by labor,
are condemned to perpetual degradation and
ignorance, by which three hundred and fifty
thousand slaveholders can govern and control
the destinies of the millions of people in the
slave States; and not only of those people, but of
this great country of ours. They not only claim
the right to take their negroes into the Territories,
but they claim to take laws there that will
deny to every man the freedom of speech and
the liberty of the press. They claim the right to
seal every man's lips, and stop every man's
mouth, on questions of great national interest.
They claim to take with them the right to condemn
as a felon the man who may utter and
maintain the Declaration of Independence, or the
opinions of the conscript fathers of the Republic.
They claim to take with them the right to condemn
as a felon the man who dares proclaim the
precepts of our holy religion. They claim to take
with them the right to strip naked and cut into
gashes the back of the man who utters opinions
that do not exactly "square and corner" with
the interests of the aristocratic slaveholders.</p>

<p>A negro population is one by no means desirable,
but a free white man could live where
there are negroes, and maintain his freedom; but
no white non-slaveholder can live where slave
laws, customs, and habits, pertain, and retain the
rights that belong to free men in free States.</p>

<p>A man may live in the swamps of the torrid
zone, and escape the crocodiles, alligators, and
other slimy and creeping things, but he cannot
escape the miasma and poison of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>If the slaveholder is permitted to go into the
Territories, and take his slave laws, habits, and
customs, the people of the free States are to a
great extent excluded therefrom, and deprived
of all rights therein.</p>

<p>But slaveholders say they will go; they will
take their slaves, and their slave code; they will
establish there such a despotism as reigns in
some of the slave States; they will poison the
air that surrounds the fertile plains of the West,
until freedom shall sicken and die; and we are
constantly told, that if we do not yield to their
unreasonable demands, this Union shall be dissolved.</p>

<p>But these threats do not move or alarm me, and
for the best of all possible reasons; I do not believe
that the gentlemen who make these threats
intend to leave their places on this floor&mdash;nor, if
they should, would the country suffer any loss.
The section they represent would still remain
under the Constitution and laws of the United
States, and our glorious flag would still wave
over its fertile plains and lofty mountains, its
woody dells and shelving rocks, its gurgling
fountains and rippling rills. Good, loyal, and
patriotic men would come here to fill the vacant
places, ready and able to discharge their duty to
the country, and to the whole country.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these threats of disunion from
the Democratic party, we hear much holy horror
expressed in regard to a sectional party, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
much laudation of a national, conservative party.
The nationality of the Democratic party consists
in devoting all the energies and power of the
Federal Government to advancing the interests,
aims, and ends, of about one hundred thousand
men. Its conservatism consists in its avowed
determination to dissolve the Union, should a
majority of our people, in the exercise of their
legal and constitutional rights, elect a President
not acceptable to that party.</p>

<p>There are, I presume, not more than one hundred
thousand men in this country who feel any
desire to extend the boundaries of slavery, or
who would, had they the power, add one other
slave State to the Union. Yet the whole power
of this Government is devoted to that one object;
its entire strength concentrated in one spasmodic
effort to extend slavery. The agricultural,
the manufacturing, the great commercial interests
of this country, are entirely ignored, neglected,
and forgotten, that the interests of one
hundred thousand slaveholders may be advanced.
The great pursuits by which twenty-five million
people live, are not considered worthy the attention
of this Democratic party; while one hundred
thousand aristocrats require its entire services.
Yet this is the great national party!
While so determined upon rule is it, that if a
majority of the people should decide against it,
and discharge its members from places of trust
and honor, they threaten to destroy this Government.
Such is the conservative party commended
to our most favorable consideration.</p>

<p>The slavery party is constantly complaining
that the free States enact personal-liberty laws,
and that they do not fulfil their constitutional
obligations. Whatever acts may be passed by
our Legislatures, so that they do not interfere
with the Constitution of the United States, you
have no right to complain. But if you think that
Constitution violated, you have your remedy.
Send your attorneys into the free States; commence
your suits in the Federal courts, and try
the validity of our statutes. We pledge ourselves
that your agents shall be kindly treated, and shall
have a fair hearing. We will not follow your
example; we will not pass laws in plain and palpable
violation of your rights, and in palpable
violation of the Constitution, and then drive out,
by threats or violence, any man who may come
into the State to test the validity of such enactments.</p>

<p>Before you complain of us, go home and seize
and hang the pirates who are hovering around
your shores, engaged in the slave trade. You
may say a jury will not convict them. Why not?
Because the community sustains them in their
unholy traffic and in their violation of the laws.
But if you really desired to punish those men,
you could easily devise the ways and means&mdash;a
whipping on the bare back with a raw-hide, a
coat of tar and feathers, or some other corrective
that you are in the habit of using. I would not
advise these punishments; in a free State they
would not be practicable; but in States where
such things are in constant use, it is rather surprising
that some person has not thought of thus
applying them. Men who commit acts declared
by the whole civilized world to be piracy, you
permit to escape, while you say you will hang
the man who circulates Helper's book. Before
you complain of the free States, arrest and punish
the scoundrels who so cruelly treated the
Irishman at Columbia, South Carolina, for no
offence but saying that slavery was detrimental
to free labor.</p>

<p>Take from place and power the men whose
hands and faces are reeking and smoking with
the blood of our people in Kansas, and put them
to death. Punish the thousands of others who
have committed acts of violence against free-State
men, and are yet unwhipped of justice.
These things you must do, before you complain
of us. I take no pleasure in these criminations
and recriminations. I know that all the States
are a part of my country; but when I hear of the
wrongs and outrages perpetrated on men merely
because they will not subscribe to the doctrines
you hold, and hear you complain of us for not
doing our duty as citizens, I will let you know
that you, too, "are made of penetrable stuff." I
have</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;">
<span class="i0">"Learned to deride your fierce decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And break you on the wheel you meant for me."<br /></span></div>

<p>I do not mean to interfere with any man's legal
or constitutional rights. The people of the
slave States have the right to continue slavery
there if they desire so to do. I have no right to
interfere with it. But I intend to maintain my
own rights.</p>

<p>To draw an impassable line around slavery, and
confine it within its present limits; an absolute
abolition of the African slave trade; the Territories
to be kept free for homes for free men&mdash;these
measures I regard as absolutely essential
to the perpetuation of this Government, and to
the highest development of the Anglo-Saxon
race. I have endeavored to show what slavery
is, what it has done, and what it intends to do.
I have also endeavored to show what are the
aims and objects of the Republican party; and
if they cannot be tolerated&mdash;if such principles
cannot be sustained by the people of any section
of this country&mdash;it is the misfortune of that people.
They are the principles that ought to be
sustained by all people that are fitted for civil
liberty; they are the principles on which this
Government was founded; they were baptized
in the best blood of this nation; they were cherished
by the greatest names that adorn the
brightest pages of the history of our country
during its patriotic and virtuous and heroic age.
They were emblazoned on every banner that
waved over our army in every battle-field of
the Revolution; during the storm and darkness,
they were the bright "signet on the bosom of
the cloud," the rainbow of promise and of hope.</p>
